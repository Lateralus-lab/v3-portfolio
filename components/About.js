            I'm currently an Engineer at Upstatement building things for the web
            with some awesome people. I recently graduated from Northeastern
            University after completing three awesome six-month co-ops at
            MullenLowe U.S., Starry, and Apple Music.

            As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering
            and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for
            design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build
            applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while
            providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

            When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably
            snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board, or crossing off
            another item on my bucket list.
